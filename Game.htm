<h1>RPG Gaming</h1> 
					 <h2>D&amp;D: Only A Game?<br>Answer: Yes!<br>Part I</h2> 
					 <h3>By Marcus Pan </h3> 
					 <p>Recently, while sitting around a campfire with friends, the
						subject of talk turned to role playing games. Of course, it was <i>AD&amp;D</i>
						in particular. As the discussion moved on, one of my fellowman pulled out a
						pamphlet entitled, "<i>D&amp;D:</i> Only a Game?" Written by a group calling
						themselves the <i>Christian Life Ministries</i>, it details the "evils" of
						<i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>. Needless to say, we had many laughs at this piece
						of work.</p> 
					 <p>Hilarious as it was, this pamphlet was still attacking all
						RPG players everywhere. It was the "last straw". I sat through all the
						scoffing, the insinuations of "extreme Satanism and evilness" within the game
						and I have listened to psychiatric arguments against the game. I've even been
						psychiatrically evaluated as an "evil, non-conforming, definitely Satanic
						person. Avid<i>D&amp;D</i> fan..." myself. But I will no longer sit idly by
						while the wonderful game of <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> is made a mockery
						of.</p> 
					 <p>Welcome to the first part of a three-part series retaliating
						against these hypocrites.</p> 
					 <h3>Part I<br>Christian Hypocrites</h3> 
					 <p><u>Warning:</u> <br>If you are an orthodox Christian who is
						easily religiously offended and do not have an open mind to other people's
						opinions&#133; </p> 
					 <p>BURN THIS MAG NOW!</p> 
					 <p>Aanton Szandor LaVey summed it up best in his <i>Satanic
						Bible</i>. I believe he hit it right when he stated the Christian church as
						hypocritical. I find this true in many instances and will chronilize my beliefs
						here for you. But I must say, these people (and I use this term loosely)
						calling themselves the <i>Christian Life Ministries</i> take hipocricy to the
						point where I actually find it intriguing.</p> 
					 <p>First of all, how can anyone or anything be "All-Forgiving"?
						In other words, no matter what you do, no matter how many sins you commit,
						"God" will forgive you with no questions asked? I wish the legal system was
						like that. In other words, no sin, however great, is unforgivable. I have seen
						the spawn of hypocrisy this breeds as I watch people sin greatly through the
						week, then forgiven on church Sunday only to perform these very same sins
						again. It forms a chain of fallacy which is hilarious to watch.</p> 
					 <p>The <i>Christian Bible</i> tells us to "turn the other
						cheek". I have yet, throughout my entire life, found anyone, of Christian faith
						or otherwise, follow this commandment. Nobody I know will sit idly by while
						some crazed lunatic who is frothing at the mouth beats the living pulp from
						their bodies. Everyone I have known will strike back and of you, dear reader,
						claim you will not you are either lying or don't know anything about the world
						we live in.</p> 
					 <p>"If one person hits you in the cheek, SMITE him in the
						OTHER!" <br>--Anton Szandor LaVey-- <br>Father of the Church of Satan
						<br>--"Satanic Bible"-- </p> 
					 <p>The above is a "Rule of the World", and if you claim
						otherwise you are obviously lost and out-of-touch with reality.</p> 
					 <p>Meanwhile, the <i>Christian Life Ministries</i> take this
						idea of sinning even further. According to them, if you so much as think an
						"unpure" or "evil" thought you are guilty of performing this thought. For
						example, if you get into an argument with another person and think to yourself,
						"I could just kill you..." you are a murderer. Haven't we all done this? I'm
						sure you have. Well, I say what's the big deal? Just simply look to the sky,
						mutter a half-hearted apology and you are forgiven. Right? This is the load of
						crap these hypocrites teach.</p>
